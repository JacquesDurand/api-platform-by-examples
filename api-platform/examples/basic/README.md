Welcome to API Platform by Examples! This is a very basic example with a few books. Click `Send` to get the list of books.

The `DataProvider` is where API Platform looks for data related to the requested Resource. Here we created one that has Books named `BookDataProvider`. 
Open the `BookDataProvider` to add a second Book!
